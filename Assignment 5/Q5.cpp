/* 
KEY POINTS:
1. Constructor Order: Base -> Derived (Top to Bottom)
2. Destructor Order: Derived -> Base (Bottom to Top)
3. Base class constructor is always called before derived class constructor
4. Derived class destructor is always called before base class destructor
5. If base class constructor requires parameters, use initialization list in derived class
